# "Co-Axiofunctio" an Ethical Operating System (Ethical OS)

**A mechanized, predictive, and self-correcting framework for universal ethics, grounded in biological pathfinding, systems stability mathematics, and falsifiable truth criteria.**

---

### Overview

Developed by me, Ace Axiomatinous started on date 29th Oct 2025 from past accumulated knowledge. A computer science engineering student, **Ethical OS** is not a philosophical treatise — it is an **engineering specification** for moral decision-making. The framework synthesizes:

- **Biological imperatives** (Tier 1: survival, reproduction, coordination)
- **Structural logic** (Tiers 1–4, Axioms 1–4, Three Laws of Inter-Species Ethics)
- **Mathematical stability analysis** (`S(G) < 0.6 → systemic collapse`)
- **Epistemological rigor** (5-criteria test for objective truth)

It has withstood adversarial stress-testing by frontier AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) and **predicts historical moral failures** — from slavery to colonialism — with perfect retrospective accuracy.

### Core Claims

1. **Morality is pathfinding.**  
   Ethics is the coordination constraint that prevents intelligent systems from destroying the collective they serve.

2. **Objective truth is reproducible, non-contradictable, and observer-independent.**  
   Tier 1 truths are endpoints of contradiction chains — not beliefs.

3. **Systems that violate broad Tier 2 satisfaction (survival, wellbeing, continuation) collapse mathematically.**  
   `S(G) = proportion with M(p) > Mₓ` — when below critical threshold, resistance coordination becomes inevitable.

4. **Utility monsters, 90/10 misery splits, and slavery are not merely "wrong" — they are unstable.**  
   The framework proves their impossibility via systems dynamics.
