# "Co-Axiofunctio" an Ethical Operating System (Ethical OS)

**A mechanized, predictive, and self-correcting framework for universal ethics, grounded in biological pathfinding, systems stability mathematics, and falsifiable truth criteria.**

---

### Overview

Developed by me, Ace Axiomatinous started on date 29th Oct 2025 from past accumulated knowledge, completed version 1 on 2nd Nov 2025. A computer science engineering student, **Ethical OS** is not a philosophical treatise — it is an **engineering specification** for moral decision-making. The framework synthesizes:

- **Biological imperatives** (Tier 1: survival, reproduction, coordination)
- **Structural logic** (Tiers 1–4, Axioms 1–4, Three Laws of Inter-Species Ethics)
- **Mathematical stability analysis** (`S(G) < Sᶜʳⁱᵗ → systemic collapse`) Where Sᶜʳⁱᵗ is the critical collapse threshold.
- **Epistemological rigor** (5-criteria test for objective truth)

It has withstood adversarial stress-testing by frontier AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) and **predicts historical moral failures** — from slavery to colonialism — with perfect retrospective accuracy.

### Core Claims

1. **Morality is pathfinding.**  
   Ethics is the coordination constraint that prevents intelligent systems from destroying the collective they serve.

2. **Objective truth is reproducible, non-contradictable, and observer-independent.**  
   Tier 1 truths are endpoints of contradiction chains — not beliefs.

3. **Systems that violate broad Tier 2 satisfaction (survival, wellbeing, continuation) collapse mathematically.**  
   `S(G) = proportion with M(p) > Mₓ` — when below critical threshold, resistance coordination becomes inevitable.

4. **Utility monsters, 90/10 misery splits, and slavery are not merely "wrong" — they are unstable.**  
   The framework proves their impossibility via systems dynamics.

> I, Axiomatinous believe in the rigorous, structural, logical and mechanized ethical framework of "Co-Axiofunctio". 

I have gone through my claims and tested them, and I am satisfied with the result obtained. I have found no clear contradictions or "black boxes", for which if possible I request you to test them out yourselves. 

I am open to criticism and civilized discussions. Majority of the writing, fact checking and researched were done by me with the help of the following AIs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and ChatGPT-5) for stress testing, application, pre publish thoughts, grammar and co-research. I grant you the rights to share and use this ethical framework for testing and any and all purposes. If possible, do credit me.
